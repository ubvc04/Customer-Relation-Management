# MongoDB Atlas Connection Setup

## 🔍 Current Status
- ✅ Backend server running on http://localhost:5000
- ✅ Frontend running on http://localhost:3001  
- ✅ Demo login working (database not required)
- ❌ MongoDB Atlas connection failing - IP whitelist issue

## 🔧 MongoDB Atlas Configuration Required

### Connection String (Current)
```
mongodb+srv://admin:Bavesh%401234@cluster0.50i8x.mongodb.net/crm_development?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

### 🛠️ Steps to Fix Connection

#### Option 1: Whitelist Your IP Address (Recommended)
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas Dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Sign in with your account
3. Select your cluster (`Cluster0`)
4. Click **"Network Access"** in the left sidebar
5. Click **"Add IP Address"**
6. Choose one of:
   - **Add Current IP Address** (most secure)
   - **Allow Access from Anywhere** (`0.0.0.0/0`) - for development only

#### Option 2: Get Your Current IP
You can find your current IP by visiting: https://whatismyipaddress.com/

#### Option 3: Create New M0 Cluster (Free)
If you don't have access to the current cluster:
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a free account
3. Create new M0 (free) cluster
4. Set up database user
5. Whitelist your IP
6. Get new connection string

## 🧪 Testing Connection

After updating IP whitelist, restart the backend:
```bash
cd C:\Users\baves\Downloads\CRM\backend
npm run dev
```

Look for these success messages:
```
✅ MongoDB Connected: cluster0-shard-00-02.50i8x.mongodb.net
📊 Database: crm_development
🟢 Mongoose connected to MongoDB
```

## 📝 What You Need to Provide

Please let me know:

1. **Have you added your IP to the whitelist?**
   - Yes/No and any error messages

2. **Do you have access to your MongoDB Atlas account?**
   - If not, I'll help create a new free cluster

3. **What's your preference?**
   - Fix current cluster
   - Create new cluster
   - Continue with demo mode only

## 🎯 Current Functionality

**Working Now:**
- ✅ Modern glassmorphism login interface

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/demo-login
```

Test MongoDB connection (after fixing):
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
